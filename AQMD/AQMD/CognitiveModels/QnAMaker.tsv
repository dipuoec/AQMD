What is air pollution?	Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and small particles suspended in the air. The different health effects of air pollution are dependent on how much of the pollutant is in the air, how long a person is exposed, as well as the person’s health conditions, age, and genetic background. Children, elderly people, and people with certain health conditions, such as diabetes, heart or lung disease, are more sensitive to the health effects of air pollution.	QnAMaker.tsv

How can I check the Air Quality in my area?	The Air Quality Index (AQI) was developed to help translate data collected from air pollutant monitoring stations into a scale. The AQI is a number that ranges from 0 to 500 that indicates how clean or polluted the air is, and what associated health effects might be of concern to diverse individuals within a population. The AQI focuses on health affects individuals may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.	QnAMaker.tsv
